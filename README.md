## Collaboration Rules

We welcome contributions from the open-source community! To ensure a smooth collaboration, please follow these guidelines:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a Branch**: Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name for your branch (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue`).

3. **Commit Changes**: Make your changes in the new branch. Ensure your commits are clear and concise. Use meaningful commit messages.

4. **Pull Request**: Once your changes are ready, open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes and the problem they solve.

5. **Code Review**: Be prepared to engage in the code review process. Address any feedback or requested changes promptly.

6. **Testing**: Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality. Write tests for new features and ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.

7. **Documentation**: Update documentation as necessary to reflect your changes. This includes README files, inline comments, and any other relevant documentation.

8. **Respect Guidelines**: Follow the project's code of conduct and contribution guidelines. Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
