# About Dashboard
They help to make the CanvasDashboard component functional by displaying dynamic information (like coordinates and zoom level) and handling user interactions like zooming and clicking.

The component renders a dashboard displaying:
1. Cursor Coordinates: Displays the current position of the cursor and the click position.
2. Zoom Level: Shows the current zoom level and provides buttons to zoom in or out.

## Usage
- The component is used to display the status of the canvas with respect to cursor movements, clicks, and zoom levels, and to allow user interaction with zooming features.

This component provides a functional and interactive dashboard for canvas-based applications where users can track their position and zoom in/out.
